Form generation
===============

vct.core can be asked to generate input forms to be reused in 3rd-party applications, so that developers don't have to handle the form-generation themselves.

We start the server:

>>> from vct.core.xmlrpc import Server
>>> server = Server('localhost', 0)
listening on localhost:0
>>> port = server.server.server_address[1]
>>> server.start(daemon=True)
>>> import time; time.sleep(0.5)

First we connect to the xmlrpc service

>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://localhost:%s' % port)

We can ask for a specific input form

>>> s.get_form('observation', 'html')
'<form id="deform" ...

When we fill in the form, we submit to our 3rd-party application. This application is then responsible for retrieving form data and sending it trough xmlrpc using the remote "put" method. The server will then validate and store data.

>>> bad_data_from_form = [('bad_data','bad_data'), ('title','test')]
>>> response = s.put('frsecu', 1234, bad_data_from_form, 'observation')
>>> print response
{'date': 'Required', 'text': 'Required', 'status': 'Required', 'link': 'Required'}

If data is not validated, the server return and error response with a dict containing details about the error. In that case, the application should ask for the form again, providing the error dict:

>>> form = s.get_form('observation', 'html', bad_data_from_form)
>>> '<input type="text" name="title" value="test"' in form
True
>>> 'There was a problem with your submission' in form
True
