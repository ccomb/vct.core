Observation
===========

We can create an observation:

>>> from vct.core.observation import Observation
>>> observation = Observation()
>>> observation.title = 'something'
>>> observation.title
'something'

We can store an observation

either like this:

>>> getUtility(IDatabase).save(observation)

or like this:

>>> IDatabase(observation).save()

which would allow to have a different database for observation or other objects
