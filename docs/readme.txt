Overview
~~~~~~~~
High level technical documentation
VCT Core is a package for patient care. (...)

It provides a minimal kernel, which can discuss with the outside world in two
ways: 
- an XML-RPC (or REST?) service allows the kernel to be used by 3rd party services.
- a plugin infrastructure allows the kernel to be extended with additional
  capabilities (databases, services, etc.) and to trigger external services.
- an optional ready to use form generation system for easy input

You can access the VCT Core services using any language and platform, through
the use of simple XML-RPC messages. See the examples section below to discover
how to use it in different languages.

We should provide generic tests for the plugin. If the third-party plugin
successfully pass the tests, it means that the plugin works.
